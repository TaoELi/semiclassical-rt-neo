# Squeezed Protons and Infrared Plasmonic Resonance Energy Transfer

The folders here contain all necessary files to generate figures in the following paper:

- Li, T. E., Paenurk, E.,  Hammes-Schiffer, S. Squeezed Protons and Infrared Plasmonic Resonance Energy Transfer. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. **2024**, 15, 751-757](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c03112)

## File structure

  1. **plotting/** There are several python scripts (ending with **.py**) in this folder. Enter this folder, try running each of them (by **python xxx.py**) to obtain all the figures in the manuscript.
  
  2. **data_proton_squeezing/** Folder for calculating proton squeezing near a gold tip.

  3. **data_ir_energy_transfer/** Folder for calculating resonance energy transfer between a quantum proton and a 1D Au chain.

## Caution

The simulations are performed in a developer version of Q-Chem. The current release version of Q-Chem does not support NEO calculations with ECP.
