# Semiclassical Real-Time Nuclear-Electronic Orbital (RT-NEO) Dynamics

The folders here contain all necessary files to generate figures in the following paper:

- Li, T. E., Tao, Z., Hammes-Schiffer, S. Semiclassical Real-Time Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Dynamics for Molecular Polaritons: Unified Theory of Electronic and Vibrational Strong Couplings. 	[arXiv:2203.04952, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04952).

## File structure
  - **plotting/** There are several python scripts (ending with **.py**) in this folder. Enter this folder, try runing each of them (by *python xxx.py*) to obtain all the figures in the manuscript and SI.

  - **HCN/**: Input files and output data for the HCN molecule.

  - **oHBA/**: Input files and output data for the oHBA molecule.
