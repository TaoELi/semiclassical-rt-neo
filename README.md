# Semiclassical Real-Time Nuclear-Electronic Orbital (RT-NEO) Dynamics

All the necessary input or post-processing files for reproducing the following publication:

**2022-rt-cavity/**

- Li, T. E., Tao, Z., Hammes-Schiffer, S. Semiclassical Real-Time Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Dynamics for Molecular Polaritons: Unified Theory of Electronic and Vibrational Strong Couplings. [arXiv:2203.04952, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04952).

Note that the current project is implemented in a developer version of Q-Chem, which has not been merged to the Q-Chem trunk, so **the current release version of Q-Chem does not support the input files in this project**. However, the necessary output data are given, so one can easily reproduce the figures in the publication by running the Python script of plotting. I anticipate the features presented in this project will be merged to the Q-Chem trunk in the near future.
