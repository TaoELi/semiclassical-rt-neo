# Energy Conservation in Real-Time Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Ehrenfest Dynamics

The folders here contain all necessary files to generate figures in the following paper:

- - Li, T. E., Li, X.,  Hammes-Schiffer, S. Energy Conservation in Real-Time Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Ehrenfest Dynamics. [J. Chem. Phys. **2025**, 162, 144106](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0255984)

## File structure

  1. **plotting/** There are several python scripts (ending with **.py**) in this folder. Enter this folder, try to run each of them (by **python xxx.py**) to obtain all the figures in the manuscript.
  
  2. **data/** Folder for the plotting data. Please decompress the files ending with **.bz2** for the raw output files. **data/analysis.sh** provides the post-processing scripts to generate data for plotting from raw Q-Chem output files.
