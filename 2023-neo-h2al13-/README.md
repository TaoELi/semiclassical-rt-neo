- Li, T. E., Hammes-Schiffer, S. Nuclear-Electronic Orbital Quantum Dynamics of Plasmon-Driven H<sub>2</sub> Photodissociation. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. **2023**](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c04927)

## File structure

  1. **plotting/** There are several python scripts (ending with **.py**) in this folder. Enter this folder, try running each of them (by **python xxx.py**) to obtain all the figures in the manuscript and SI.

  OTHER FILES ARE BEING UPLOADING NOW...
    

## Caution

The simulations are performed in a developer version of Q-Chem. The current release version of Q-Chem does not support BO-RT-NEO simulations.
